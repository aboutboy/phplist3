Feature: Manage admins
    In order to give other people access to my phpLIst Installation
    As an admin user
    I need to be able to add them, define right access and check people I have added

Scenario: Check options on the admin page
    Given I have logged in as an administrator
    Given I follow "Config"
    Given I follow "Manage administrators"
    Then I should see "Add new admin"
    And I should see "Find an admin:"
    And I should see "Administrators"
    And I should see "Import list of admins"
